This is a device that is meant to be operate in two modes. 
The automatic mode and the remote controled mode. 
In the automatic mode, the device is meant to avoid obstacles and record whatever it comes across vi a camera module 
while in the remote controlled mode, the device is to be controlled remotely via a wireless connection(not decided yet))
